Developing and Testing
======================

When testing a copy of Mound from Git, you'll want to make sure that the
/etc/xdg/userdata file is linked to your copy in the branch (or at least exists
and has some content). Otherwise, the application list will most likely be
empty and there won't be anything to test!

Alternatively, Mound will also look in ~/.config/userdata for definitions.
