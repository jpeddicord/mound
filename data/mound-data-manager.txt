SYNOPSIS
========

``mound-data-manager``

OPTIONS
=======

``mound-data-manager`` does not accept any command-line options.

DESCRIPTION
===========

Mound Data Manager is a GTK+ application that can be used to manage data for individual applications. This includes taking snapshots, rolling back, and other data operations.

USERDATA
========

Applications can be managed by Mound by adding a line to the application's .desktop entry.
To do so, an `X-UserData` line must be added:

    X-UserData=locations
  
where ``locations`` is a semicolon-separated (;) list of files and/or directories that can be managed. These locations must be inside the home directory, and so must start with ``~/`` followed by the data location. The following substitutions are supported:

:$XDGCONFIG: the home XDG configuration directory; usually ~/.config
:$XDGDATA: the home XDG data directory; usually ~/.local/share
:$XDGCACHE: the home XDG cache directory; usually ~/.cache

An application can also be managed with an entry in /etc/userdata; see the `FILES` section below for more information.

FILES
=====

/etc/userdata
-------------

Contains defaults for mound-data-manager to load when an `X-UserData` line is not present in a .desktop entry.
The format of this file is:

    desktop-file-name userdata-locations;

where ``desktop-file-name`` is the basename of the .desktop entry without the extenstion, and ``userdata-locations`` is an `X-UserData` value.

EXAMPLES
========

Example entry in a .desktop file:
  X-UserData=~/.config/myapp;~/.local/share/myapp

Equalivalent to the above example:
  X-UserData=$XDGCONFIG/myapp;$XDGDATA/myapp

Entry in /etc/userdata:
  myapp ~/.myapp
